# Personal-Project
This is my personal project where I have made a blood bank management system. You can contribute to this repository by finding the issues from Issue section. Before making any PR, please recheck twice. This repository is perfectly suitable for beginners.
A request to the beginner is that,  please attach before and after screenshot while you make a PR. It will make my work a little bit easy then. 
Happy Contributing :)
